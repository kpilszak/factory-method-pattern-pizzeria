## General info
This project shows usage of factory method pattern.  
The main principle is: "Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes."  
In factory method pattern we rely on inheritance.  
Object creation is delegated to subclasses which implement the factory method to create objects.  
We define an interface for creating one product.
